Minimal dotfiles
================

A minimal set of dotfiles that makes life on a remote machine a lot nicer.

## Installation instructions

Never install anything by piping curl into bash.

To install these dotfiles run the following command:

```bash
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielVoogsgerd/minimaldotfiles/main/install.bash" | bash
```

Updating can be done a lot more legitimately using the included `update_dotfiles` command.

## Contributing

If you find a problem -- bug or otherwise -- in these files, feel free to open a pull request.
If you would like to add something new, please open up an issue first.
I try not to be too opinionated in these files and stay close to the real nature of the application,
however dotfiles are always going to be a bit opinionated.
